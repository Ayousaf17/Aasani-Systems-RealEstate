## Known Productions Outreach Template

**Final version (Aasani Lens approved):**

```
Hey [Name],

It's Ayub — we worked together through Known Productions.

Quick question: do you know any real estate agents drowning in admin work?
I started helping agents get their time back by building systems that handle the busywork.

Not pitching you — just looking for intros to the right people.

```

**Key changes from original:**
1. Dropped "consulting practice" — too corporate/vague
2. Changed "automation" → "systems that handle the busywork" — outcome-focused
3. "Not pitching you" — confident, not apologetic (vs. over-explaining)
4. Clean URL at the end

## Aasani Lens Evaluation

**Language transformation applied:**
| Avoided | Used Instead |
|---------|--------------|
| "consulting practice" | "I help agents..." |
| "through automation" | "systems that handle the busywork" |
| Over-apologizing | Single confident line |

**Personas who approved:**
- Skeptical Realtor: "drowning in admin work" resonates
- AI-Curious Human: "systems" is less scary than "automation"
