    question: 'What tools do you work with?',
    answer: 'We work with the tools you already use — Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, Gmail, Google Calendar, Zillow, Realtor.com, and 30+ more. We connect them, not replace them.',
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't have any systems yet?",
    answer: "That's actually a great starting point. We help you choose the right tools for your business and set them up connected from day one. No wasted subscriptions.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this different from hiring a VA?',
    answer: "A VA does tasks manually. We build systems that run automatically. When a VA leaves, your processes leave with them. When we build systems, they're yours forever.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why can't I just use Zapier myself?",
    answer: "You can try. Most agents do and give up within a month. We've built 100+ real estate integrations. We know what breaks, what scales, and what actually saves you time.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How long until I see results?',
    answer: 'Most clients see their first automation live within 2 weeks. Full system implementation takes about 90 days, but you start saving time from week one.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does the 3-month commitment cover?',
    answer: "Month 1: We audit and build your foundation. Month 2: We optimize and expand. Month 3: We fine-tune and hand off ongoing management. After that, it's month-to-month.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you replace my CRM?',
    answer: "No. We make your existing CRM work better by connecting it to everything else. If your CRM is truly not working, we'll recommend alternatives, but we never force a switch.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if something breaks?',
    answer: "We monitor your systems and fix issues proactively. If something breaks, we fix it — usually same-day. You don't need to diagnose anything or learn any tools.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I cancel after the 3-month minimum?',
    answer: 'Yes. After the initial 3 months, your partnership is month-to-month. Your systems keep running either way — we built them to last, not to lock you in.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does the discovery call look like?',
