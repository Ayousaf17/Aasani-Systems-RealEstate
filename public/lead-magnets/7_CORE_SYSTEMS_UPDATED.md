Prepared by: Ayub Yousaf, Aasani.ai

## System #1: INSTANT LEAD RESPONSE SYSTEM

### The Problem
- 78% of buyers work with the first agent who responds.
- 53% of buyers expect a response within 1 hour.
- Most agents respond in 4-6 hours (or never).

### What This System Does
- Instant SMS confirmation: Sent within 60 seconds of lead capture.
- Script: "Hi [Name]! Thanks for your interest in [Property]. I'm [Your Name] and I'll call you tomorrow at 10 AM. In the meantime, here are 3 similar listings..."
- Automated email: Sends personalized property recommendations immediately.
- Task reminder: Prompts you to call within 24 hours.
- CRM logging: Automatically logs lead source and behavior.
- "Hot Lead" Alert: Slack/SMS alert sent to you immediately if the lead is marked "hot."

### The Integration (How We Wire It Together)
**Lead reaches out → Twilio SMS captures it → Zapier connects to your CRM → CRM logs lead + marks it hot if criteria met → Zapier triggers personalized email from your account → You get Slack notification**

Everything automatic. Zero manual steps. Your existing tools, now talking to each other.

### The Back Office
Need to adjust the SMS message? Change when you get notified? Add a new property recommendation? We handle it—you're not rebuilding workflows in Zapier or reconfiguring your CRM. You call, we update it.

### Typical ROI
- 8x higher conversion when responding within 5 minutes vs 30 minutes.
- Capture 78% of leads who would otherwise go to faster competitors.
- Zero manual work required 24/7.

**Tools Used:** Twilio (SMS), Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, LionDesk, or your existing CRM + Zapier.

## System #2: LEAD QUALIFICATION & SCORING

### The Problem
- Not all leads are equal (some are ready to buy, others are browsing).
- Agents spend the same time on cold leads as hot leads.
- No visibility into who is most likely to convert.

### What This System Does

**1. Automatic Point Assignment:**
- Opened email: +5 points
- Clicked property link: +10 points
- Visited site 3+ times: +20 points
- Used mortgage calculator: +30 points
- Saved favorites: +25 points

**2. Lead Categorization:**
- Hot (50+ points): Immediate personal follow-up.
- Warm (20-49 points): Automated nurture sequence + weekly check-in.
- Cold (0-19 points): Monthly newsletter only.

**3. Smart Routing:**
- Hot leads → Immediate notification to you.
- Warm leads → Drip campaign.
- Cold leads → Long-term nurture.

### The Integration (How We Wire It Together)
**Lead activity (emails, clicks, visits) → Tracked in your CRM → Zapier calculates points based on your rules → CRM updates lead score automatically → Hot leads trigger Slack alert to you + auto-assign to your calendar → Warm leads enter nurture sequence → Cold leads go to newsletter**

The system watches every interaction and routes accordingly. You focus on the hot ones.

### The Back Office
Want to change the scoring rules? Adjust the point values? Create a new lead category? We do it. Your system adapts without you touching a spreadsheet.

### Typical ROI

While you sleep, the system is keeping 50+ leads warm.
